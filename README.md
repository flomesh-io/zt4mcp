# zt4mcp (Zero Trust for MCP)

**zt4mcp** is a framework for AI application developers and runtime, it provides a robust framework and a set of tools to ensure that every interaction within an MCP ecosystem is explicitly verified, access is granted on a least-privilege basis, and a breach is always assumed. It enable developers and organizations to confidently leverage the full power of MCP by:
* Enhancing Security Posture: Implementing granular access controls, strong authentication, and continuous authorization for all MCP clients, servers, and tools.
* Mitigating Risks: Protecting against known MCP vulnerabilities such as tool manipulation, unauthorized data access, and malicious command execution.
* Fostering Trustworthy AI: Building a safer environment for AI agents to operate, interact with data, and execute tasks.
* Promoting Secure Adoption: Providing a practical and accessible Zero Trust solution to encourage the secure development and deployment of MCP-enabled applications.

While zt4mcp provides powerful Zero Trust capabilities, it’s also very simple to setup and  easy to use with GUI, CLI and RESTful API.

## Why zt4mcp?

Traditional security models are often insufficient for the unique, dynamic, and trust-sensitive nature of MCP environments. Recognizing this critical gap, we are proud to introduce zt4mcp (Zero Trust for MCP) – an innovative open-source project dedicated to implementing a comprehensive Zero Trust security architecture specifically tailored for the Model Context Protocol.

### For developers

* 🔒 No Trust Assumed: Developers can build and test tools in isolated environments using mTLS and cert-based identity—reducing risk from untrusted networks or nodes.
* 🚀 Faster Iteration: Connect securely to remote MCP servers without VPNs, even behind NATs and firewalls. Ideal for local testing with real production models.
* 🧩 Tool Safety Built-In: Tool descriptions are semantically validated and vetted for integrity, preventing tool poisoning during development.
* 🔍 Deep Observability: Full audit logging, runtime traceability, and real-time debugging across distributed components.
* ⚙️ One Protocol to Rule All: Securely stream outputs from MCP tools over STDIO/SSE/WebSockets, fully integrated into IDEs.
* 🌐 Local Integration Made Easy: A built-in local RESTful API simplifies the development of AI apps and MCP Runners, enabling faster and more flexible prototyping.

### For AI powered application production usage 

* 🔐 End-to-End Zero Trust: Every agent-tool interaction is verified, scoped, and logged—ensuring safe execution even in adversarial settings.
* 🌍 Internet-Wide Reach: Painless NAT/firewall traversal allows agents to access MCP servers and tools anywhere in the world.
* 🧠 Guardrails for Agent Autonomy: Fine-grained, time-bound permissions prevent agents from overstepping their scope.
* 📦 Tool Tampering Prevention: Schema validation, behavior monitoring, and trusted repositories mitigate the risk of manipulated tools.
* 🔄 Dynamic & Compliant: Apps can adapt in real time, while maintaining auditability and policy enforcement across interactions.

### For Enterprise

* 🛡️ Defense-in-Depth Architecture: Leverages OWASP-guided controls and research-backed Zero Trust layers across all MCP components—client, server, and tool chain.
* 🧾 Audit and Compliance Ready: Every action is logged, traceable, and backed by TLS/mTLS—meeting enterprise regulatory demands.
* 🔐 Federated Identity & Access: Integrates with enterprise IAM (OAuth2/OIDC/LDAP) for seamless access control and SSO.
* 🎯 Least Privilege + Just-In-Time Access: Reduce breach impact with fine-grained, ephemeral permissions for each tool or user session.
* 🧠 Smart Threat Detection: Detects abnormal tool behaviors, impersonation attempts, and enforces protocol-level validation.
