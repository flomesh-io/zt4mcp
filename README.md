# zt4mcp (Zero Trust for MCP)

**zt4mcp** is a framework for AI application developers and runtime, it provides a robust framework and a set of tools to ensure that every interaction within an MCP ecosystem is explicitly verified, access is granted on a least-privilege basis, and a breach is always assumed. It enable developers and organizations to confidently leverage the full power of MCP by:
* Enhancing Security Posture: Implementing granular access controls, strong authentication, and continuous authorization for all MCP clients, servers, and tools.
* Mitigating Risks: Protecting against known MCP vulnerabilities such as tool manipulation, unauthorized data access, and malicious command execution.
* Fostering Trustworthy AI: Building a safer environment for AI agents to operate, interact with data, and execute tasks.
* Promoting Secure Adoption: Providing a practical and accessible Zero Trust solution to encourage the secure development and deployment of MCP-enabled applications.

While zt4mcp provides powerful Zero Trust capabilities, it‚Äôs also very simple to setup and  easy to use with GUI, CLI and RESTful API.

## Why zt4mcp?

Traditional security models are often insufficient for the unique, dynamic, and trust-sensitive nature of MCP environments. Recognizing this critical gap, we are proud to introduce zt4mcp (Zero Trust for MCP) ‚Äì an innovative open-source project dedicated to implementing a comprehensive Zero Trust security architecture specifically tailored for the Model Context Protocol.

### For developers

* üîí No Trust Assumed: Developers can build and test tools in isolated environments using mTLS and cert-based identity‚Äîreducing risk from untrusted networks or nodes.
* üöÄ Faster Iteration: Connect securely to remote MCP servers without VPNs, even behind NATs and firewalls. Ideal for local testing with real production models.
* üß© Tool Safety Built-In: Tool descriptions are semantically validated and vetted for integrity, preventing tool poisoning during development.
* üîç Deep Observability: Full audit logging, runtime traceability, and real-time debugging across distributed components.
* ‚öôÔ∏è One Protocol to Rule All: Securely stream outputs from MCP tools over STDIO/SSE/WebSockets, fully integrated into IDEs.
* üåê Local Integration Made Easy: A built-in local RESTful API simplifies the development of AI apps and MCP Runners, enabling faster and more flexible prototyping.

### For AI powered application production usage 

* üîê End-to-End Zero Trust: Every agent-tool interaction is verified, scoped, and logged‚Äîensuring safe execution even in adversarial settings.
* üåç Internet-Wide Reach: Painless NAT/firewall traversal allows agents to access MCP servers and tools anywhere in the world.
* üß† Guardrails for Agent Autonomy: Fine-grained, time-bound permissions prevent agents from overstepping their scope.
* üì¶ Tool Tampering Prevention: Schema validation, behavior monitoring, and trusted repositories mitigate the risk of manipulated tools.
* üîÑ Dynamic & Compliant: Apps can adapt in real time, while maintaining auditability and policy enforcement across interactions.

### For Enterprise

* üõ°Ô∏è Defense-in-Depth Architecture: Leverages OWASP-guided controls and research-backed Zero Trust layers across all MCP components‚Äîclient, server, and tool chain.
* üßæ Audit and Compliance Ready: Every action is logged, traceable, and backed by TLS/mTLS‚Äîmeeting enterprise regulatory demands.
* üîê Federated Identity & Access: Integrates with enterprise IAM (OAuth2/OIDC/LDAP) for seamless access control and SSO.
* üéØ Least Privilege + Just-In-Time Access: Reduce breach impact with fine-grained, ephemeral permissions for each tool or user session.
* üß† Smart Threat Detection: Detects abnormal tool behaviors, impersonation attempts, and enforces protocol-level validation.

## How zt4mcp Works

**zt4mcp** enables secure, decentralized communication between local developer tools or AI-powered applications and remote LLMs or MCP servers using the ZTM (Zero Trust Mesh) network.

![How zt4mcp works](docs/images/internals.png)

### Overview

This architecture provides a secure mesh network using mTLS, allowing local tools and applications to interact with remote services like LLMs and MCP servers. The key elements in this system include `ztm agents`, `ztm hub`, and `ztm filter chains`, which work together to ensure authentication, encryption, access control, and threat protection.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Agent Installation**  
   Developers install a `ztm agent` (local gateway) on their machine, or AI-powered apps bundle it directly.

2. **Local Communication**  
   Applications or IDEs communicate with the local `ztm` gateway using HTTP (typically on `localhost:7777`).

3. **Mesh Network Communication**  
   The ZTM mesh uses mTLS for:
   - Authentication & Authorization  
   - Access Control  
   - Threat Detection  
   - Auditing  
   - Routing  
   - Network Encryption/Decryption  

4. **Server-Side Integration**  
   On the server side, the `ztm agent` relays traffic securely to LLMs or MCP servers via HTTPS or STDIO/SSE/WebSocket protocols.

### Security Filters (ztm filter chains)

![Filter Chain](docs/images/filter-chain.png)

Each agent can enforce a series of customizable filters, such as:

- **MCP Tool Posing Check**
- **OWASP WAF (Top 10, CORS, etc.)**
- **OAuth2/OIDC Authentication**
- **Time-Bound Permissions**
- **Observability**

These chains ensure security, compliance, and observability at both endpoints of communication.
